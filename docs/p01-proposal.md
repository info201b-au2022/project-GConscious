## Abstract
In this project we are focusing on the increase of hate crimes from the years 2019 and 2020. We selected these 2 years because there was an uptick of hate crimes in 2020 stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The hate crime data is being extracted from government databases which will be used to analyze hate crime rates for each state.

## Keywords
Hate crime, discrimination, bias, targeted groups.

## Introduction
The project will focus on analyzing hate crimes from the years 2019 and 2020. In 2020, the COVID-19 virus had turned into a global public health emergency first originating from China. Throughout the course of the year, there was a large and rapid increase of hate crimes committed against people of East Asian descent and only worsened as the pandemic dragged into 2021. We will be exploring hate crime statistics provided from an FBI database where incidents are reported and compiled from local law enforcement agencies across the country. Using that data, we can compare it to other factors like geography, race of aggressors, income levels, etc.
