## Abstract
In this project we are focusing on the increase of hate crimes from the years 2019 and 2020. We selected these 2 years because there was an uptick of hate crimes in 2020 stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The hate crime data is being extracted from government databases which will be used to analyze hate crime rates for each state.

## Keywords
Hate crime, discrimination, bias, targeted groups.

## Introduction
The project will focus on analyzing hate crimes from the years 2019 and 2020. In 2020, the COVID-19 virus had turned into a global public health emergency first originating from China. Throughout the course of the year, there was a large and rapid increase of hate crimes committed against people of East Asian descent and only worsened as the pandemic dragged into 2021. We will be exploring hate crime statistics provided from an FBI database where incidents are reported and compiled from local law enforcement agencies across the country. Using that data, we can compare it to other factors like geography, race of aggressors, income levels, etc. 

## Problem Domain

## Research Questions
1. **How does a state’s mean income per capita correlate with the number of hate crimes committed in that state?**
This question is to check how the mean income of the average citizen will affect the rate at which hate crimes are committed. It helps us understand whether a lower quality of life, which can be measured through the average income, will lead to a higher level or frequency of hate crimes that are committed. 


1. **How and which individuals were impacted by hate crimes between 2019 and 2020?**
 This is quite a straightforward question speaking to the quality of life for certain people who were impacted by the hate crimes and how it changed between the 2 years of 2019 and 2020.

1. **What offenses of hate crimes increased in frequency between 2019 and 2020?**
 This research question is more or less straightforward and speaks to how the people and the trends in which hate crimes were committed between the year 2019 and 2020 and which group of people have been targeted more, or which hate crime may have been committed the most.

## The Dataset
1.  Describe how your dataset is related to your problem domain and, specifically, to your research questions. That is, how will your dataset enable you to answer your research questions?
  Our first source is the [FBI crime data explorer](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads) which contains both our 2019 and 2020 datasets.  This source is crucial to the answering of our reasearch questions as it displays all hate crimes in those years, the state they occurred in, and certain attributes of the victim and offender.
  Our second source is the 
  
  
1. Include a table that presents the name of each data file, the number of observations (rows), and the number of variables (columns). (3) Include a full citation to each data file, including URL.

1. Finally, describe the provenance of your dataset, addressing such key questions as: (a) Who collected the data? When? For what purpose? (b) How was the data collection effort funded? Who is likely to benefit from the data or make money? (c) How was the data validated and held secure? Is it credible and trustworthy? (d) How did you obtain the data? Do you credit the source of the data? (About 400 words.)

## Expected Implications
Our project will show the ways in which poverty and disease can affect social tensions and how these  areas of our socioeconmic scenario are intertwined and can affect one another, stressing the importance of maintaining a healthy and happy population in order to achieve maximum human well-being.  

It will also show what groups are most targetted by what types of hate crimes, showing what has yet to be done in order to ameliorate persistent inequality and bigotry.

## Limitations
Our analysis is limited due to the fact that are several things that are left out of our dataset as they are difficult to quantify or measure.  Although the motivation of the hate crime is listed (ie. anti-LGBT, anti-Black, anti-white) the only characteristics listed of the victim and offender's identity is race and age. these include the victim's gender identity and expression, sexual orientaion, disability status, income level, etc.  Even with race, many columns are simply listed as "unknown," age is only categorized as "adult" or "juvenile", this prevents deeper analysis on the ways that intersecting oppressed identities may affect hate crime statistics.

Our analysis will also exclude hate crimes that go unreported as there is no data on them. This may end up affecting the data so that groups that have easier access to law enforcement or are more comfortable reporting to law enforcement are overrepresented as victims.
